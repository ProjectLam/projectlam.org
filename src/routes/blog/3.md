## Practice scales. 
Scales are sequences of notes played one at a time in ascending or descending order. Practicing scales can help you improve your finger dexterity and prepare you for playing more advanced pieces. As a beginner on the guitar, it's important to start with simple scales that use open strings and easy-to-play frets. The pentatonic scale is a great scale for beginners to start with as it only has 5 notes per octave, making it easy to learn and memorize. Another scale that is easy for beginners is the C major scale, which can be played using all open strings on the guitar. It is also important to practice proper techniques such as maintaining good hand position and using proper finger placement when playing scales. As you become more advanced, you can explore more complex scales such as the natural minor scale and the blues scale.

Last but not least, find music that you enjoy and try to play along. As you become more comfortable with the guitar, you can try learning songs by ear or by following along with guitar tablature (tabs) online. Remember to take breaks and be patient with yourself as you learn. Playing the guitar can be a rewarding and enjoyable hobby, and the more you practice, the better you will become. And try not to be shy when showcasing your talent to everyone, despite everything that casts doubt on you. You are talented!
