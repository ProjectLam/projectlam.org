desc: A guide to getting started with tips on choosing the right guitar, understanding the parts, and holding it properly
---

Starting anything is very challenging, but once you understand the techniques, pick up the language, and practice regularly, you can accomplish it. Let me show you how to start playing guitar and what you need to know. 

## Choose your favorite Guitar! 
  Regardless of which one you choose as a beginner, you could start down the path to mastering the guitar. However, you might discover that one type feels natural and enjoyable to play while another frustrates you. Therefore, you need to choose a guitar that is comfortable for you to hold and play, depending on your guitar-playing goals. An acoustic guitar is a good choice for beginners, as they are relatively simple to learn on and does not require any additional equipment (such as an amplifier). And they are known as the most evenly matched type of guitar in terms of sound and playability, and they take the shortest amount of time to grasp the fundamentals of playing. So grab the one you like most and start practicing now!

## Familiarize yourself with the parts of the guitar. 
  They can be broken down into three main parts: the headstock, neck, and body.  
  **Headstock :**  located at the end of the neck, it holds the tuning pegs which are used to tune the strings.  
  **Neck :** The neck of the guitar is the long thin piece that extends from the headstock to the body. It is usually made of wood, and it is where the frets, fretboard and strings are located.  
  **Body :** The body is the largest part of the guitar and it is where the sound hole, bridge, and saddle are located. The sound hole helps to amplify the sound, while the bridge and saddle support the strings and transfer the vibrations to the body.

**Other parts include:**  
  **Frets :** thin metal bars that run perpendicular to the strings and are used to play different notes.  
  **Fretboard :** the surface on which the frets are embedded.
  Nut: located at the top of the fretboard and helps to hold the strings in place.  
  **Truss rod :** a metal rod that runs inside the neck and is used to adjust the neck's curvature.  
  **Strings :** the six thin wires that stretch across the guitar and are plucked or strummed to produce sound.

## Learn how to hold the guitar properly. 
  It's important to find a comfortable position that works for you and your body. It can take time to find the right position, but with practice, you will be able to play comfortably and effectively. Sit up straight with your back against the back of the chair and place the guitar on your right thigh (if you are right-handed) or your left thigh (if you are left-handed). The guitar should be angled slightly towards your body then position the guitar so that the neck is parallel to the ground and the body is at a slight angle. Be aware that keep your left hand (if you are right-handed) or right hand (if you are left-handed) in a relaxed position with your thumb behind the neck and your fingers curled naturally and use your right hand (if you are right-handed) or left hand (if you are left-handed) to hold the pick or fingerpick the strings. Donâ€™t forget to make sure your elbow is close to your body and your wrist is in a neutral position. Lastly, try to keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid hunching over the guitar.
