“I am Busy” is a phrase that we hear almost everyday. (I can relate to that as well) Nowadays, people are busy with both personal and professional life and it seems to eat up the time of enjoyment from your favorite guitar. Here are three tips and tricks to make busy people like you enjoy your time more with guitar.

## 1. Place your guitar next to your bed (and play it everyday)

  This is quite cliché for this to be such an advice, but it actually works. Think about it!  Number of people place guitars where it is hard to reach to begin with, places like, over the cabinet, in the storage room, or in the bag under the stack of cloth, guess what! The chance of playing it is zero. We tend to do things that are least resistant such as the thing around you (might be checking social media), so you don’t have to walk and get it. Make playing guitar as your first option right after you awake as a part of your morning ritual.

## 2. Find your 25 minutes daily (no more no less)

  James Clear, the writer of the number one New York Times bestseller book, Atomic Habits once said “Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.” One might think playing the instrument needs tons of time to practice, but the magic number here is 25 minutes each day. I adapted this idea from the book “The Pomodoro Technique” by Francesco Cirillo. The concept of the book is to divide the time into a block of 25 minutes (1 pomodoro) with a short break of 5 minutes. 25 minutes is the appropriate amount of time for you to not procrastinate, and be more productive to your daily guitar task. The key here is to practice systematically 25 mins everyday throughout the week then practice 3 hours every three-day. Yeah!! You are busy!  you won’t have much time anyway.

## 3. Find your own kind of online guitar learning resource
  We all learn in different ways. One might learn better with a private personal music instructor, while others might learn best independently. For busy people like you it might be inconvenient to make real time appointments with your instructor. The best option for you might be learning it through a recorded online learning resource that can be accessed anytime, anywhere and more importantly fun. The music gamification software (Check out our _[Project Lam](https://projectlam.org/)_)  might be great options to learn effectively while having fun. Like many music game software's features, on our software you are able to detect audio interface , learn multiple courses and song categories. Moreover, you can track your progress effectively as your level goes up.

  From my experience teaching music online for many years, I will tell you that online learning truly works as long as you are consistent and keep tracking your progress in-check. Hoping some of those simple tips like  “Place your guitar next to your bed” will help you to kick-start the journey of guitar playing.
